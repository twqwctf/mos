 0   14:  *                                                                              *
 0   15:  * This program is MOS, the menu operating system. It allows the user to        *
 0   16:  * view and manipulate directories under the UNIX operation system.             *
 0   17:  *                                                                              *
 0   18:  * The screen consists of two directories. Upon execution, both directories     * 
 0   19:  * are the current directory- (where the command to execute MOS was from)       *
 0   20:  * The user is allowed to traverse the directory. This is done two ways. The    *
 0   21:  * user can press the up & down arrow keys to move in the directory up and      *
 0   22:  * down respectively, or skipping twenty files at a time, up or down, is        *
 0   23:  * allowed. Also, the user may toggle between the two directories. Note:        * 
 0   24:  * the program is limited to a maximum of one-hundred files and or directories  *
 0   25:  * in a directory list.                                                         * 
 0   26:  *                                                                              *
 0   27:  * In addition, the user may enter other directories. In this way, it is        *
 0   28:  * possible to display any two-directory combination at once in the directory   *
 0   29:  * hierarchy.                                                                   *
 0   30:  *                                                                              *
 0   31:  * The main feature of the program is the capability to perform UNIX operating  *
 0   32:  * system commands between the two directories displayed. The commands cp,      *
 0   33:  * rm, more, vi, mkdir, rmdir, & mv can be accessed. Also, several of these     *
 0   34:  * commands can performed in multiples. In this way, the user can tag a group   *
 0   35:  * of files and has the choice to perform a cp, rm, or mv routine. Another      *
 0   36:  * feature enables the user to un-tag all files in a directory at once. The     *
 0   37:  * pathname for the directory appears beneath each directory list.              *
 0   38:  * When the user has completed his or her tasks, the exit command returns the   *
 0   39:  * user to the directory from where he or she first executed MOS.               *  
 0   40:  *                                                                              *
 0   41:  * Input: Input is mainly directly from the user. However, the program does     *
 0   42:  *        access the external devices by calling the system routine, another    *
 0   43:  *        from of input.                                                        *
 0   44:  *                                                                              *
 0   45:  * Output: The only output is printed to the screen and written to external     *
 0   46:  *         files /tmp/ls/out and /tmp/pwd.out.                                  *
 0   47:  *                                                                              *
